Leveraging Natural Language Processing to classify player sentiment about the Borderlands universe

🚀 About the Project

This is my first step into Natural Language Processing (NLP), and I'm excited to explore various techniques to analyze player sentiment in the Borderlands gaming community. Using machine learning and NLP, this project aims to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral based on players' opinions.

🌟 Key NLP Features

Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal

TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts text into numerical features for machine learning

Sentiment Classification: Logistic Regression model to predict sentiment

Explainable AI: Highlights key words influencing predictions
